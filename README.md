# IPod

IPod can play, pause, and skip music. This project was done while I participated in Open Project Space by IEEE. The key components of this project: MISP32 microcontroller, DFPlayer Mini, speaker, 1k Ohm resistor, and two buttons. Two input pins of the microcontroller are connected to a button each configured with a input pull up resistor through the microcontroller. Themicrontroller is connected to the DFplayer mini via tx rx pins and the DFplayer mini is connected to the speaker.
